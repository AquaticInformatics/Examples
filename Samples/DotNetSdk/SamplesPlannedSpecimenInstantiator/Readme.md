# Samples Planned Specimen Instantiator

Download the [latest SamplesPlannedSpecimenInstantiator.exe release here](../../../../../releases/latest)

This Windows GUI tool will:

- Retrieve all field trips with a field visit with a "Planned" status
- Allow you to select multiple field visits
- Change the selected field visits to "In Progress" and instantiate each specimen in the visit

Once the planned specimens are instantiated, the Samples UI can be used to export and deliver a report of planned specimens to laboratories.
